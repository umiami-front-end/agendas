# CIM 439/639: REMOTE LESSON No. 3 (April 6, 2020)

Greetings!

## HOUSEKEEPING

### !!! QUIZ !!!

You have a quiz this week. It will cover:

- CSS Units
- CSS Specificity
- Reading from Chapters 1-4 of "Adaptive Web Design" by Aaron Gustafsson

The quiz can be found on Blackboard in the "Assignments" menu. Look for "CSS Units & Specificity."

The quiz **MUST** be completed by *Friday, April 10 at Noon.*  You will have 60 minutes to complete 30 questions. Once started, the test must be completed in one sitting. Do not leave the test before clicking Save and Submit. If time expires, the t﻿est will save and be submitted automatically.

**THESE ARE HARD DEADLINES!** Tests not completed within the allotted time or before the deadline will be scored as such. "I forgot" is not an acceptable excuse. "I didn't read this email until Friday" is not an acceptable excuse. "I closed my browser window" is not an acceptable excuse.

I strongly recommend you study before beginning the test. You will not have time to look up answers. You may not seek aid from or provide aid to another student. You are to complete this on your own. Anything the *slightest* bit suspicious will be marked as a zero (0). **DO NOT CHEAT! You are on your honor.**

### Check-Ins

Most everyone is doing fine on check-ins, but a reminder that you need to be *done* with the work for the week when you check-in Friday at noon. It is not acceptable to emailing me by the deadline and to say you will complete the work later.

The work we're doing with JavaScript builds on previous lessons every week. You *cannot* hold off doing the work and expect to get it done in one sitting before the project is due. Further, the end-of-the-week check-in is the time for you to ask questions about that week's work. So if you've blown off the last two weeks and come to me next week with questions about data types, arrays, objects, etc. time to get those questions answered has passed.

You have complete flexibility to complete the work as you see fit -- one sitting, multiple sittings, 3 a.m., etc. -- but you need to be *DONE* by the time you email me Friday before noon.

### Extra Credit

The notes, exercise and project rubric for the SVG extra credit assignment has been posted. It is due Monday, April 27, 2020 by noon.

You will need to email me for what you will be assigned to build out. Because this is extra credit, I will not provide assistance on this project (though I will answer questions related to the notes and/or exercise). Working on the extra credit will not supplant your weekly work (so don't check in saying you worked on SVG, but not that week's JavaScript lesson).


## THIS WEEK

TOPIC: JavaScript Control Flow and Loops

Control Flow: What happens when a computer program needs to make a choice? It is done through control flow -- if, if-else and switch-case statements.

Loops: What happens when you want a computer program to do something over and over again? Loops handle this. (Computers are very good at doing repetitive tasks!)

Please do not hesitate to email throughout the week if you have questions!
