# CIM 439/639: REMOTE LESSON No. 6 (April 27, 2020)


## HOUSEKEEPING

### !!! QUIZ !!!

**DUE: Wednesday, May 6, noon.**

You have a quiz this week. It will cover:

- JavaScript
- readings from Chapters 1-4 of "JavaScript for Web Designers" by Mat Marquis
- command line
- git

The quiz can be found on Blackboard in the "Assignments" menu. Look for "JavaScript, Command Line and Git."

The quiz **MUST** be completed by *Wednesday, May 6 at Noon.*  You will have 30 minutes to complete 15 questions. Once started, the test must be completed in one sitting. Do not leave the test before clicking Save and Submit. If time expires, the t﻿est will save and be submitted automatically.

**THESE ARE HARD DEADLINES!** Tests not completed within the allotted time or before the deadline will be scored as such. "I forgot" is not an acceptable excuse. "I didn't read this email until Friday" is not an acceptable excuse. "I closed my browser window" is not an acceptable excuse.

I strongly recommend you study before beginning the test. You will not have time to look up answers. You may not seek aid from or provide aid to another student. You are to complete this on your own. Anything the *slightest* bit suspicious will be marked as a zero (0). **DO NOT CHEAT! You are on your honor.**


### JavaScript Project

**DUE: Wednesday, May 6, noon.**

The rubric has been posted for the [javascript project](https://github.com/umiami-front-end/04-javascript-project).


## THIS WEEK

TOPIC: Ajax and APIs

This week's topic is a very broad overview of Ajax and APIs.

Ajax -- Asynchronous JavaScript -- handles the transfer of data from other servers to be used in our web site.

APIs -- Application Programming Interfaces -- is a way we can use JavaScript to interact with data, features of HTML5. In fact, as you have been working to modify the DOM, you have actually been working with an API. The APIs which can be used for the web is quite vast. The notes cover a few related to the browser, but also external APIs in which you can pull in data from another source.

### Course Notes

- `21-ajax`
- `22-api`

These are posted in the `course-notes` repository on GitHub.

### Examples

- `11-ajax-api`

Ajax relies on communication with a web server. If you drag the files in the above repository into your browser, they will not work. To create a simple web server on your computer, the easiest way to do this is install the `atom-live-server` plug in.

The `weather` example uses Ajax to pull in the National Weather Service API. If you want a slightly easier way to just get Ajax up and running, view the `space` example, which uses a minimalist library called [Zepto](https://zeptojs.com/) to handle the Ajax calls. The `geolocation` example demonstrates one of the many Web APIs available!

### Reading

Explore the Mozilla Developer Network's list of [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). You are not required to know any specific APIs, but this will at least give you some ideas of the many things you can work with in just a web browser! (Avoid obsolete APIs!)

### Exercises

None. (Project in lieu of an exercise this week.)

### Check-In

You've got an automatic check-in this week as I know everyone will be "checking in" on Monday with their final project.

There is no need to email unless you have questions.

If you turn your project in before Monday, feel free to email me and I can get to grading it ASAP.


## FUN

### Last Week

**POLL:** Do you prefer hot or cold weather?
- Hot: 80%
- Cold: 20%

(I guess that makes sense given you chose to attend Miami! :) )

**SHORT ANSWER:** What is the most interesting/exciting place you have visited?

Caroline W.: The most interesting/exciting place I've visited is hard to name, as I've been fortunate to travel see some really cool places. I'd probably have to say the one that sticks out the most is just Ireland as a whole. My father is from there, so we've gotten to go a fair amount of times. I love the juxtaposition between the country side and the seaside towns and the historical cities and everything in between. There is nothing like it!

Nicole A.: The most interesting place I've visited in the US was Sedona, Arizona.
International has been Costa Rica, so lush!

Olivia R.: The most interesting place I have been is Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). Unfortunately there is a genocide occurring there right now.

Haoran Z.: The most interesting place I have visited is Copenhagen (Denmark), there are many ancient streets in the city, and also lots of great modern architectures, is a treasure for history lovers and a “Holy Land” for designers. Coincidentally, I love both history and design.

Christina M.: Costa Rica!

Jessenia M.: I went to Chicago a year ago, it was really nice. The deep dish pizza is so good!

Hao H.: As for the most interesting place that I visited, I would say Tokyo. It is my favorite city and I have been there twice. It’s really a cool city and the culture is very attractive. People who like animation would never miss this amazing place.

Liz E.: This is a tough one. But in my top places, definitely one was visiting "under the sea."  Though it's not a hobby today, it was amazing to visit a coral reef, be surrounded by schools of fish and swim through a ship wreck in Ft. Lauderdale, while getting my scuba certification many moons ago.

Emil C.: Probably the most interesting place I've been to was Lebanon. My dad's from there so I went to visit my family. However I was like 8 so I don't remember it at all. I have been to Tokyo twice, it's probably my favorite place in the world. The first time I went by myself for like a week and met up with some friends later, but the second time I went with 7 of my closest friends for the entire time and it was probably the best experience of my life.

Liza S.: I would probably say Iceland. We camped there with my family on one of those house-on-wheels cars for a week and I don't think I have ever had a more exciting and unusual experience!

Damaris Z.: I am stuck between Puerto Rico and France for the most exciting place I have visited. In France, I got the change to go to the palace of Versailles. I absolutely love old art, so it was amazing to see the architecture and art in person. In Puerto Rico, I got to go into the only rain forest part of U.S. soil. The plant life was so beautiful and there were a few exotic flowers I got pictures of that I still love to this day.

### This Week

No questions this week. Concentrate on your projects and quiz. ;)

That's it for this week!

Looking forward to seeing everyone's projects!
