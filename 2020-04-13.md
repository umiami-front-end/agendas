# CIM 439/639: REMOTE LESSON No. 4 (April 13, 2020)

Hello! Hope everyone is staying safe!


## HOUSEKEEPING

### Office Hours

A quick note about office hours. This is not meant to discourage anyone from booking. (Please book! I am happy to help look over your work, code with you.) I just want to make sure everyone is thoughtful and courteous moving ahead.

I tend to get a flood of meetings when projects are nearing a due date. I have tried to set up a lot of opportunities to meet online to make sure everyone can at least get a little time.

If you book an appointment...

1. Consider emailing me first. I may be able to answer your question(s) via email. If it's something where I need to actually see all the code, I'll let you know. Trust me.

2. Install your software before we meet. Don't waste time doing that during the session.

3. If it's the first time we are meeting online, book two consecutive appointments. This is to assure the software is setup correctly. Hopefully it works without a hitch and we can spend more time on the code!

4. When booking future meetings (after the first), please only book one 20-minute session at a time. (If there are no appointments after your time is up, you're welcome to have the available time. But I want to make sure everyone has a chance to meet with me!)

5. *This is important.* If you do not need/want to meet after you have booked an appointment, please cancel it ASAP. Please don't wait until the last 15 minutes. Try to cancel at least 1-2 hours in advance. If students book times and don't keep to them (or cancel with such short notice), it closes off a lot of options for others.


## THIS WEEK

TOPIC: JavaScript Functions and Modifying the DOM

We're going to wrap up the building blocks of JavaScript and finally get into using the language to modify our web pages!

JavaScript functions allow us to write code which can be re-used. Think of them as recipes. While this week's exercises touch upon functions, think of them as writing small scripts. This will give you practice building out more involved programs. One way to approach this is -- before you every write a piece of code -- break down each step. What needs to happen in each part of the program?

As for modifying web pages (Finally! Yes!) ... we're actually modifying the document object model we learned about several weeks ago. There are 'tools' (methods) built into every web browser which allow us to modify our pages. We can add or delete elements, apply attributes, even change content.


### Course Notes

- `17-javascript-functions`
- `18-modifying-the-dom`

These are posted in the `course-notes` repository on GitHub.

### Examples

- `08-modifying-the-dom`

Enter the commands from 18-modifying-the-dom notes in the console to practice modifying the DOM. You may need to use the browser's inspector to view changes which are not necessarily visible (i.e. adding ore removing an id/class).

When the page is refreshed, any changes made via commands typed into the console will be wiped out.


### Readings

**Adaptive Web Design**
- Ch. 5: Interaction is an Enhancement

**JavaScript for Web Designers**
- Ch. 5: DOM Scripting


### Exercises

- `exercise-13` (functions)
- `exercise-14` (modifying the DOM)

A quick note about the first task in exercise-14: You would never build out a whole page in JavaScript. You might do something like iterating an array or object to create a list, but not to add components like the meta tag. That said, it's a good basic exercise which allows you to build components of a page to get familiar with modifying the DOM!


### Check-In

Please send a check-in email by *FRIDAY, APRIL 17 at NOON*.


## FUN

### Last Week

Please include your response in your weekly check-in.

**POLL:** Are you eating healthier since switching to online classes?
- Yes: 80%
- No: 20%

**PHOTO:** Co-workers -- your pets!

Thank you for all who shared. I have compiled these for viewing at: https://github.com/ebrown15/fun


### This Week

**POLL:** Have you started or have you considered starting a home garden (outdoors, kitchen, etc.)?
- Yes:
- No:

(If you're thinking, "Where did *that* question come from?" ... I was inspired by the following story from the [News@TheU](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2020/04/gardening-is-good-for-your-sanity-and-your-sustenance.html)! And if you have interest, when we return to school, [you can learn](https://greenu.miami.edu/topics/food-and-well-being/gardens/index.html)!)

**SHORT ANSWER:** Your Hometown! I realize many students have returned home, and we all come from a variety of awesome places. Tell us about it! Where is your hometown? Give us a few facts about it. (If you are in a major metropolitan area, stick to the city/neighborhood you are from -- for instance, I grew up in Davie, Florida, which has a rodeo arena and holds an annual orange blossom festival. The downtown even looks like a little Western town.)

...

That's it for this week! Be safe!
