# CIM 439/639: REMOTE LESSON No. 5 (April 20, 2020)

Hello!

We're almost in the home stretch!


## HOUSEKEEPING

### Tech Book GOLDMINE!

The library came through BIG TIME! with a subscription to O'Reilly Media's Safari Library. If you have never come across it, has a ridiculous number of books and videos, all tech-related. Most of the major tech book publishers have content included here. (Your textbooks are available!) On the [O'Reilly Sign In](https://www.oreilly.com/sign-in.html) page, you should be able to sign in with an organization. This is similar to the many other subscriptions UM has.

Whether for this class, other classes or your own personal pursuits, I strongly recommend checking it out!

### Looking Ahead

The last two things which need completion in this course are the JavaScript project and JavaScript/Command Line/Git quiz.

The JavaScript project will provide you with a few options to code. These are designed to be focused and within the limits of what we have learned in class. (The problem with letting students do what they want is either a) they underdeliver or b) way beyond the scope of this class.) I am trying to add a couple more options to the JavaScript project and hope to have that posted within the next week.

I am tentatively setting the last quiz to be completed by Wednesday, May 6, 2020 at Noon (the last day of class.) I plan to set that up for next week.

### Extra Credit

Remember, if you plan to do the extra credit, you must email me for your assigned flags. I will not accept projects from students who chose the flags on their own.


## THIS WEEK

TOPIC: DOM Events and Forms

If last week you were thinking, "Okay, when would I use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM?" you will get a better sense this week!

DOM events let us know the details of how a user interacts with our web page. When this occurs, we can gather all sorts of data -- such as whether they clicked on a portion of the screen, entered data, etc. And when that interaction occurs, we can change the web page using the DOM manipulation techniques we learned last week!

As for forms, this is a primary way of gathering data from a user. (Sorry, no more using the alert/comfirm/prompt methods!) We build out these input fields in HTML, then write JavaScript to gather, process and output that data.

It's worth noting, at this point a lot of students confuse front-end and back-end. Most forms we interact with have a back-end component -- our data is sent to a server and processed. For this class, anything we use forms for is *only* handled on the front-end. The JavaScript we write will process and output the information only within the user's browser! Keep that in mind -- there is no external storage!


### Course Notes

- `19-dom-events`
- `20-forms`

These are posted in the `course-notes` repository on GitHub.

### Examples

- `09-dom-events`
- `10-forms`

This week's examples are as important as the notes as they demonstrate the concepts in very simple versions!


### Readings

I realize the readings last week were a little difficult ... I've listed them here again in case you need a re-read. I am not expecting students to understand everything in Chapter 5 of "Adaptive Web Design." Rather, there are general ideas (unrelated to code) which are worth filing away in your mental Rolodex. :)

**Adaptive Web Design**
- Ch. 5: Interaction is an Enhancement

**JavaScript for Web Designers**
- Ch. 5: DOM Scripting


### Exercises

- `exercise-15` (DOM events)
- `exercise-16` (Forms)



### Check-In

Please send a check-in email by *FRIDAY, APRIL 24 at NOON*.


## FUN

### Last Week

**POLL:** Have you started or have you considered starting a home garden (outdoors, kitchen, etc.)?
- Yes: 72%
- No: 28%

Special thanks to Katy H., who introduced me to the [Little River Cooperative](https://littlerivercooperative.com/), a nursery and farmers market in the Miami neighborhood of Allapattah! If you are still in Miami and want some plants for gardening, check them out! :)

**SHORT ANSWER:** Your Hometown! Thanks to everyone who participated! Lots of good details! (Some entries may be lightly edited for typos.)

Brendan C.: I'm from Ridgewood, New Jersey. Jordin Sparks and Jeff Feagles are probably the most notable people to have lived here. I live about 30 minutes from New York City with no traffic (but theres always traffic). A nice suburban town in North Jersey!

Liza S.: I grew up in Moscow, Russia, and actually had quite an interesting experience as from fifth grade I went to an international school, while still having a lot of purely Russian friends who wouldn't speak very good English, so I always kinda had to be splitting myself between those two groups of friends. Moscow is an absolutely beautiful city and while it holds a lot of stereotypes I think it is a must visit for everyone, and while not a lot of people speak English, it is filled with a looooot of history and friendliness!

Jessenia M.: I’m from Miami, Florida. I have lived here my whole life. As you very well know, it’s a melting pot which is why I love it so much. The beach and nightlife are fun and the Miami Beach Convention Center holds Supercon every summer, which I often attend. Unfortunately, it might have to be canceled this year, but we’ll see!

Haoran Z.: My hometown is Jinzhou, located in Liaoning province which is in the northeast part of China. It's a beautiful small city. There is an ancient tower in the center of the city, people always say that if you see the tower, that's means you are home, so every time when I see a picture of this tower, I miss my home. My hometown is the barbecue capital of China. From my perspective, barbecue is the taste of hometown.

Lavisha B.: My home town is Hong Kong. Super far away from here and super different. The best way I can describe it would be New York City in Asia. Hong Kong is a super fast paced city that never sleeps.

Emil C.: I was born in Puerto Rico. but I grew up in Miami. Specifically Coral Gables, but I now live alone in Coconut Grove.
Some cool facts: The music video for George Michael's "Careless Whisper" was shot in Coconut Grove. Coconut Grove was also the setting for the movie "Meet the Fockers." It's the oldest continually inhabited neighborhood in Miami.

Kaimin L.: My hometown is Nanjing, China. It has served as the capital of six Chinese dynasties and also the republican government. There are many historical sites now served as tourist attractions. I can't say how much I love it, but I wish everyone has a chance to visit there. ❤️

Olivia R.: I am from Fort Collins, Colorado which is an hour north of Denver and half an hour from the Wyoming border. It is a town of 160,000 so not too small but not really city-esque. We are about two hours from nice ski resorts so despite the stereotypes, clearly not all of Colorado is a ski town. I think it was a great place to grow up and I know I will be moving back here eventually!

Damaris Z.: My hometown is Atlanta, Georgia! Before my parents moved this fall I lived 10 minutes away from downtown, so I had a lot of easy access to known sites such as the Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coke!

Emily H.: My hometown is Annapolis, Maryland.  My parents moved there right before I was born, so I’ve lived there my whole life!  We’re known for our sailing, crabs, Old Bay seasoning, and historic downtown area right on the Chesapeake Bay.  A less fun fact: We had a mass shooting two years ago, the Capital Gazette shooting. It hasn’t been really the same since.

Christina M.: Bowie, Maryland -- I am currently at my apartment in Miami but I do miss my Maryland home! Maryland is known for their blue crabs and I am located 20 minutes outside of D.C.

Caroline W.: Grand Rapids, Michigan! It seems like it'd be a quaint, unknown midwestern town, but it is actually pretty unique, wide, and fun! It goes by many many names. Once known as Furniture City during the rise of industrialism (home to Steelcase and the like), it is now referred to as Beer City, USA, due to the copious amounts of breweries everywhere (and I mean everywhere) around the city. Founders, Bells, and the like are some of the most iconic, but little microbreweries like "Mitten Brewing Company" and "Gravel Bottom" are also widely beloved. There are plenty of neighborhoods here as well, ranging from historic to gentrified to picket fence to "higher rise" apartments. We are also home to Art Prize, which used to be an annual, exciting art fest that gathered works from artists around the world. They have since changed their format, though, so it is different now than it was my whole childhood. Overall, being away from GR during college so far has forced me to garner more respect and appreciation for my hometown, if you can't tell! Could talk about it endlessly.


### This Week
