# CIM 439/639: REMOTE LESSON No. 1 (March 22, 2020)

Greetings!

I apologize for the length of this document. It is kind of like starting anew. Lots of housekeeping this week.

## HOUSEKEEPING

### If you have not...

For those who have not responded to my Thursday, March 19 email, please do so. There is a significant amount of information about the process moving forward for this class.

### Office Hours

I will have online office hours. We will use a plug-in for Atom called Teletype which will let me see your code, and Microsoft Teams to facilitate audio chat. (I am not using video/screen sharing because it requires high bandwidth and computing resources.)

Please review the [office hours](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/office-hours) document on the course web site for a walkthrough on getting set up, just in case.

I still recommend *sending an email first* with your question(s). You just may not need a meeting. Trust me, if I cannot answer without seeing the details of your code, I *will* let you know. We can then arrange a meeting. I am *not* saying you cannot schedule a meeting, just consider email might be a better, quicker solution!

Of course, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment for other issues. I'm here to listen if you need that, too. :)

### Chatroom?

I realize we are finding our ways to be social in this time of isolation. I am considering setting up a chat room on Microsoft Teams.

Students can use it to hang out, ask questions of each other, share ideas, work examples, look for others to remote pair program with, etc. (With the Teletype plugin, it is possible to pair program!)

If that is something of interest, let me know. :)

### Quizzes

I haven't forgotten about the CSS quiz! :) We will be moving quizzes to Blackboard. I will always send a reminder in our weekly email.

Since Blackboard is new to this course, I want to make sure everyone has familiarity with the software.

Please sign into [Blackboard](https://courses.miami.edu) and visit the Assignments page on the CIM 639 site. This is where quizzes will be posted. You should see an option for "Front-End Fundamentals - Test Run."

If you would like three (3) points of *extra credit!* (applied to an area of need to boost your final grade), please take this quiz. (It is basically a survey.)

This test will be timed, but there is no penalty for answering "wrong." Pay no attention to the grade Blackboard returns. It will not factor into your grade.

### Reminder

The Responsive Project is due Wednesday, March 25 at noon.


## THIS WEEK

TOPIC: Introduction to JavaScript

Whenever I teach code, I assume the subject is completely new to students. I realize some have had previous experience, so this start may be a little boring. Please be patient. :)

A quick note about the JavaScript notes. I try to provide very simple examples that you try in the browser's JavaScript console as you follow along with the notes. The "console basics" example also gives you a taste of this. Be sure you give it a try before moving on to this week's exercise.

There is only one JavaScript project at the very end. I want you to give yourself the time to practice and make mistakes. My goal for you is not just being able to complete the project, but for you to feel confident in your abilities to code something in the future, to feel like you know what you're doing. :)

This takes practice. It takes time (which we have a lot of these days!). Maybe try a little of the exercise each day with the goal of finishing by Fridays at noon. Or maybe do the exercise in one sitting early in the week, then re-do it bit by bit every day. (Sometimes that first attempt is a deer-in-headlights feeling, but not as bad the second or third time!)

### Course Notes

- `10-javascript-101`
- `11-javascript-syntax`

These are posted in the `course-notes` repository on GitHub.

### Examples

- `07-javascript-intro`

Make sure you try the `console-basics` example.

### Readings

**JavaScript for Web Designers**
- Introduction
- Ch. 1: Getting Set Up

If you do not have a copy of your book, please let me know ASAP. I will look for an alternative. (I do not see the book as available online through Richter Library yet. :( )

### Exercises

- `exercise-07`

In order to keep GitHub from being cluttered, *all exercises and solutions will now be in the solutions repository on GitHub.*

I recommend giving the exercises an honest try before you look at the solution. There may be times your solution is perfectly fine -- have faith in your abilities! :)

If you try something which works and the solution I provide is different, please do not hesitate to reach out. We can discuss. Not everything is black-and-white! :)

### Check-In

Please send a check-in email by *FRIDAY, MARCH 27 at NOON*.

Remember, the check-in does not have to be anything more than saying you are good with the material or asking questions if you have any.


## FUN

What's the saying? "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."

Every week, I am going introduce a fun and unrelated question/task to keep ourselves looking forward and positive while we are holed up at home. :)

Participation is *completely optional*, but I ask for the permission to share any longform responses with everyone else. I will only identify you by your first name, last initial. Polls are anonymous.

Please include your response in your weekly check-in.

**POLL:** Have you reconnected with a friend or family member in the past 10 days?
- Yes
- No

**PHOTO:** Your battle station!

What's a battle station? In nerd parlance, it's your desk setup.

In my tips email, I recommended putting aside a workspace to help you focus. Someone already sent me a photo of theirs! So how about we all share?

...

That's it for this week! Be safe!
