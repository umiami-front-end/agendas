# CIM 439/639: REMOTE LESSON No. 2 (March 30, 2020)

Greetings!


## HOUSEKEEPING

### COMMUNICATION IS KEY!

I cannot stress this enough:

If for some reason you feel ill, have a family member dealing with illness, are returning home, or some other major issue, **YOU NEED TO CONTACT ME ASAP!**

I recognize these are *very serious* times. I am fully prepared to accommodate legitimate situations as they arise. But **you need to be proactive in communicating with me.**

If you fail to let me know, I cannot help. I cannot give you breathing room for this class. I cannot put you in touch with people at the University who can be of assistance with a variety of resources.

There have already been students who emailed with quite an array of matters that have come up. We have figured out plans that are suited for each student's situation, whatever they may be. Some are minor, some are very serious. But we've worked something out.

As I said in class on the first day -- if you were going to miss work or a deadline for a project at work, you *would not* tell your boss after the fact. You must be up front about whatever problems are not permitting you to achieve your best. Delaying this information is irresponsible. (And this is not just a policy related to this class -- *it is how the world works!*)

Ultimately, if issues arise **you must keep lines of communication open with me.** Email (and I guess Microsoft Teams chat) is the only way we have contact. I don't want to micromanage and be on top of everyone every day (you would become really annoyed, really quickly; besides, you are all adults and I respect that). So it is very important that you communicate if something arises on your end.

If there is nothing else you take away from any classes this semester, let the importance of proactive communication be it!


### Check-ins

Reminder: For your "attendance," I require a check-in no later than Friday at noon. A number of you did not check in last week. This will result in a deduction on your attendance grade as was outlined in the updated syllabus **you all confirmed receiving and reading.**

You have complete flexibility in when you want to work on each week's material -- in one sitting, broken up throughout the week -- but it needs to be completed by Friday at noon.

Why? If you have questions, it gives me time to give you an adequate response. Or if perhaps more detail (that cannot be easily explained via email) is required, we need to set up a one-on-one session for early the following week. I can clarify what you don't understand.

It is imperative you cover the material and do the exercises (**not** just look over the solution). **Doing** is how you will learn.

This material continues to build on what has already been covered. If you put it off until you try to work on the project(s), you will find yourself in a world of misery.

### Chatroom

I did not receive any substantial interest in setting up a class chat, so I will not be doing so.


## THIS WEEK

TOPIC: JavaScript Data Types

A few of you were curious about the code we wrote last week. This week we will get a little more in-depth in working with the building blocks for any code -- data types.

We'll cover the most basic types -- booleans, numbers and strings -- as well as arrays and objects.

Last week was easy, so we are going to ramp-up this week. There is a significant amount of work to be completed. Give yourself ample time to *complete and comprehend* it.

I recommend trying to complete one exercise a day. Some of the work done in the exercises this week will be used in a future week! (If you blow it off now, it *will* come back to haunt you!)

Please do not hesitate to email throughout the week if you have questions!

### Course Notes

- `12-javascript-data-types`
- `13-javascript-arrays`
- `14-javascript-objects`

These are posted in the `course-notes` repository on GitHub.

### Examples

No 'formal' examples this week. All the code provided within the notes can be typed into the console. (The notes are actually your examples!) Do this mindfully. As you type in the code (and get a response), be aware of what the line of code is doing.

For instance, one of the first slides with an example is in `12-javascript-data-types`. The line is:

```javascript
"Hello, " + "world!";
```

Type that into your console. Hit Return. See what happens. If a result is expected from entering that line of code, the content in the notes after the double slashes (`//`) is the answer.

Also, be curious. Try making a change to have the line do something *you* want or break the code so it doesn't work. This is one of the best ways to learn!

### Readings

**JavaScript for Web Designers**
- Ch. 2: Understanding Data Types

The library still has not posted a digital copy of this text.

If you do not have a copy at this point, a digital version can be purchased at [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers). If you need a discount code for 10% off (the total comes to $12.60) please email me.

### Exercises

- `exercise-08` (variables and data types)
- `exercise-09` (arrays)
- `exercise-10` (objects)

A exercises and solutions are posted in the `solutions` repository on GitHub.

### Check-In

Please send a check-in email by *FRIDAY, APRIL 3 at NOON*.

Remember, the check-in does not have to be anything more than saying you are good with the material or asking questions if you have any.



## FUN

### Last Week

**POLL:** Have you reconnected with a friend or family member in the last 10 days?
- *Yes* 100%!

(That is nice to hear. Now that we seemingly have a lot of time available, it's good to reconnect! Friends and family will get us through this time, and I'm sure those who you reached out to feel the same!)

**PHOTO:** Your battle stations.

Thank you for all who shared. I have compiled these for viewing at: https://github.com/ebrown15/fun


### This Week

Please include your response in your weekly check-in.

**POLL:** Have you gotten the chance to enjoy something in your recent downtime you might not have under normal circumstances?
- Yes
- No


**SHORT ANSWER:** What books, television series or video games have been your go-to while stuck at home? (max 3, please). Maybe we will find some new suggestions with your recommendations! :)


...

That's it for this week! Be safe!
